Here comes main idea behind the chained project, to improve configurability, maintenability, to be less verbose, to ease the integration between our chains codebase with Spring and give a few tweaks.\r\n\r\nExcept from [_apache commons-chains_](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-chain/) project page:\r\n>A popular technique for organizing the execution of complex processing flows is the [\"Chain of Responsibility\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_responsibility) pattern, as described (among many \r\n>other places) in the classic \"Gang of Four\" design patterns book. Although the fundamental API contracts\r\n>required to implement this design patten are extremely simple, it is useful to have a base API that >facilitates using the pattern, and (more importantly) encouraging composition of command implementations >from multiple diverse sources.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario we have stateless commands executing logic and modifying the state of a context which will be shared along the chain. \r\n\r\nA common pattern is to have warm-up and clean up code to be executed before and afterwards the execution of a chain, so we have a special type of command called Filter which implements the [Pipelines and filters](http://webcem01.cem.itesm.mx:8005/apps/s200911/tc3003/notes_pipes_and_filters/) where at the beginning and end of any chain we are given the chance to execute some computation needed.\r\n\r\nAn in memory store is bundled - with a size of (Commands * k) where k is the revisions to be kept in memory  - as optional. The _RevisionGenerator_ is responsible to maintain _snapshots_ -or _diffs_- of context changes. It eases the time to undo some command executed earlier on using the [Memento Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou can find more about the components and the inner working of the chainable on the [WIKI](https://github.com/bemobi/chainable/wiki)","google":"UA-4441795-9","note":"Don't delete this file!
